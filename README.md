# Drone Delivery
This is my final work at University (TFG) for my studies in Aerospace Engineering in Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid. It is about a drone delivery project in Madrid and the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages over conventional delivery.

In this project (written in spanish) you will find:

- The .pdf document
- The .pptx presentation
- The Coding (in MatLab) and data used from excel files

Any questions you may have, contact me: kikevilla2000@gmail.com

You are more than free to use the code and everything else. The code needs a lot of improvement so wouls be nice if you wanted to experiment further with it!

Cheers
